"Hey, I wanted to talk. I feel like we’re growing apart, and it’s best we go our separate ways."
"This isn’t easy, but I need to be honest. I don’t see this working out anymore."

"I respect you a lot, but I don’t think we’re on the same page anymore."
"This isn’t because of anything you did, I just feel like we both need something different."
